from fastapi import APIRouter

router = APIRouter()

# Here you can define your route handlers and include them in the router
# For example:
# @router.get("/items/")
# async def read_items():
#     return [{"item_id": "Foo"}, {"item_id": "Bar"}]

# To include this router in your main application, you would do something like:
# from . import router as api_router
# app.include_router(api_router.router)
